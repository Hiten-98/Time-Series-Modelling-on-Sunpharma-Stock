# Time-Series-Modelling-on-Sunpharma-Stock

This my academic project in which I have demonstrated my ability to work with **Time Series Data**.

Data is **Sunpharma Stock** and length of data is of **10 years**.

Following steps are taken to perform modelling:
1. Dealing with missing data
2. QQ plot
3. Transforming data
4. Seasonal decomposition
5. Checking stationarity on close price (ADF Test)
6. Making data stationary
7. ACF & PACF Plots
8. MA Models
9. LLR Test between different MA Models
10. Analyzing Residuals
